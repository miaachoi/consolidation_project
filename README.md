The "Tuple Out Dice Game" is a dice game where players aim to reach a target score without 'tupling out' (rolling all dice to the same value). Players take turns rolling three dice. If two dice match, they are considered "fixed," and only the remaining dice can be rerolled. Rolling all three dice to the same value ("tupled out") ends the turn with zero points. After each roll, players can decide to reroll unfixed dice or stop and add their current total to their score. The game checks after each turn if a player's score has reached or exceeded the target, declaring them the winner.

Example Game Play:
1. Enter the number of players: 2
2. Enter the target score to win: 50
3. Player 1 rolls: [1, 2, 2]. Fixed dice: [2].
4. Player 1 decides to reroll. New roll: [2, 4].
