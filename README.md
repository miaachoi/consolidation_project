The "Tuple Out Dice Game" is a dice game where players roll three dice each turn. 
The goal of this game is to accumulate points by fixing duplicate dice ("tupling out") and rerolling the remaining dice. 
The first player to reach or exceed a total score of 100 wins the game. 
On each turn, the game rolls three dice automatically.
If all three dice are the same, it is called "tupled out," and the player's turn ends with 0 points for that roll. 
If any two dice show the same value, they are "fixed," and the third die is rerolled.
Players can choose to stop and keep their current score or continue rolling to improve their score.
